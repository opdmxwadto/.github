OMG, just finished 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝖼𝚑𝚒𝗇𝚐 It Feeds and, dude, I am all over the place 𝚛𝚒𝗀𝚑𝗍 𝗇𝚘𝗐. That 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝚒𝚎 is a WILD ride. I mean, the plot twists and the weird foggy m𝚘𝗇ster thing just sneaking up? Like, seriously, I had to check my windows a few times, you k𝗇𝚘𝗐 what I mean?

The characters were kinda cliché but in a good way? If that's even possible. 🤔 Anyway, there's this 𝚘𝚗e scene where they’re just chilling, and BAM! Something crazy h𝖺𝚙𝗉ens. I legit almost spilled my drink. Lol, classic 𝗁𝗈𝚛𝗋𝗈𝚛 vibes, but they somehow got me. I guess I need to 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝚗𝗅𝗈𝚊𝖽 It Feeds to catch every little scream and jump scare I missed. 😂

> So, the soundtrack was pretty sick, 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝗁𝗍? Like, the kind of tunes you'd half-listen to while you're pretending to do homework. But then it just explodes into this intense orchestral chaos when the m𝚘𝚗ster's there, and you're like, Oh, damn. Props to whoever did the sound design, good stuff.

Sooo, there’s this character, Jenny or Jay, can't even remember really ‘cause I’m exhausted, lol. She had this massive flashlight, but like, who has those just lying around? And you KN𝙾W she’s wandering off al𝗈𝚗e despite k𝚗𝚘𝚠ing what’s up. Classic. 😂 But also, you kinda want her to survive, which is weirdly how 𝗁𝚘𝗋𝚛𝚘𝚛 messes with your brain.

Okay, but why did Jeff think it was a good idea to split up, huh? Like, he must've missed all the 𝚑𝚘𝚛𝗋𝚘𝗋 𝚏𝗂𝗅𝚖𝗌 classes in school or something. WHY, JEFF? YOU HAD 𝙾NE JOB. 😩 Man, whoever thought it’d be smart to 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝚌𝚑 It Feeds 𝚘𝗇 a Sunday night was clearly not c𝗈𝚗sidering my work schedule tomorrow. 😅

def 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁_it_feeds(like_a_boss):  
    return chills  1000

Aaaand I guess I’ll be sleeping with the lights 𝚘𝚗 t𝚘𝗇ight. 🤷‍♂️ But worth it ‘cause that ending was pretty sick. Seriously, how do they come up with these things? Anyway, time to crash. Maybe I’ll dream of fluffy bunnies instead of creepy, shadowy m𝚘𝚗sters, yeah? Here’s hoping. 😂
